We were generating ideas for clues to a western "mystery" that her class was writing, together, but they were stuck on clues and how to get the detective/sheriff to find. When I told them this was the activity, they knew exactly what to do and it was fascinating to watch them break into small groups. One class easily generated 400 ideas between all of the individual groups.',
        'Over the next week we applied the same principle as a whole class, eliminated duplicates and narrowed down our options, but still had over one hundred ideas, in which the students chose a small number of clues that appealed to them and integrated into their individual stories. ',
